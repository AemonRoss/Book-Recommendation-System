Book Recommendation System

Project requirements
Many people like reading, and they are often on the look-out for the next interesting book to read. Book Recommendation System provides a platform for readers to express their opinion on books they have read and liked and find interesting new books to read.
The developed system must, at least, allow the following:
• Users to register and login using username and password credentials.
• Readers to add a book to their "main" collection, which should include details about the book title, author(s), publisher, publication date, and category.
• Readers to add "named" collections to their account, which should include a name defined by the reader. Regarding the multiple collections readers can have, they must be able to add or remove books to/from any of their own collections.
• Readers to view a list of their collections and click into any of these collections to view the books they contain.
• Readers to look through the books contained in the collections of other users (for instance, given another user's username). They must also be able to view the top 10 most recently added books to any of their collections.
• Readers to search for books by name or author, which should bring up a results list that includes a summary of the name, author, and year of publication for each matching book. Reading reviews can also help in selecting the right book to read.
• Readers to add a review for any of the books that they have read, which should include a rating out of 5.

• Readers, upon locating a book through any of the means provided by the platform, to view its full details (including the book's reviews). The book's full details must also include the average rating for the book, based on all ratings given for the book. Apart from the average rating, readers must be able to see a total count of the number of readers that have read a given book.
• Readers to filter out any books from search results that are under a given average rating. They must also be able to view recommendations for books to read based on a selected book, and a selected recommendation mode. A recommendation mode represents one way to calculate/determine what to recommend, and multiple modes must be offered. For instance, one given recommendation mode could make use of one or more of these variables: average rating for a book, author, category, how often books appear in other readers' collections.
• Readers to set a goal for the number of books they would like to read per month and, based on when books are added to their collections (or a "date-read" field defined when a book is added to a collection), show historically when they met their goal.

You need to come up with, at least, eight (8) functionalities including, at least, two (2) novel functionalities with respect to existing related book recommendation systems.
